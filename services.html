                            <p class="main-text">We help partners develop product strategy and bridge it with their broader organizational priorities. This includes working together to improve systems, processes, and governance structures that impact the product.</p>

                            <p class="main-text">Our approach typically includes user research, co-design facilitation, <a class="red-link" href="">accessible wireframes</a>, usability studies, and visual design.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="main-text">Technology is not neutral. We understand that the ways we engage with our work are as important as the products we build. As such, there are several priorities that govern our work.</p>
                <h3 class="small-title">Accessible and Inclusive Engagement</h3>
                <p class="main-text">We are proud to be an organizational signer of the <a class="red-link" href=""> design justice principles </a>, and are committed to producing accessible interfaces, following inclusive design practices, and building <a class="red-link" href="">consentful tech </a>.</p>
                <h3 class="small-title">Research and Co-Design</h3>
                <p class="main-text">We rely heavily on the expertise and priorities of those for whom the technology we work on poses the greatest risk.</p>
                <p class="main-text">We work with our partners and community experts to identify, recruit and pay co-designers with relevant lived experience. We then create accessible, inclusive artifacts, including screen-reader accessible <a class="red-link" href="">wireframes </a>, consent grids for data storage, mock privacy policies and interaction models, narrative user flow descriptions, and use cases.</p>
                <p class="main-text">Throughout, we gather input through multiple channels to account for different engagement styles. We strive to provide opportunities for sign off on work product from co-designers, and credit co-designers as co-authors.</p>
                <h3 class="small-title">Hands-On Project Management</h3>
                <p class="main-text">We believe clear communication and reliability are as valuable as well executed design and engineering work. Our project managers facilitate the process for transparently creating and maintaining backlogs, estimating effort and impact to prioritize work, measuring and reporting velocity, and managing timelines and budget.</p>
